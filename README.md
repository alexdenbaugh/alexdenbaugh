## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alex!
I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer based in Irvine, CA. My coding journey began when I took "Intro to C Programming" while I was studying Mechanical Engineering at Cal Poly SLO.  

After graduating, I worked in a non-technical role for Cru, a religious organization that mentors college and high school students, but after 2 years, I realized my heart and passion was in the tech industry.

Shortly after that, I enrolled in an Accelerated Web Development Program called LearningFuze. After 800+ hours of programming (80 hours/week), I fell in love with programming.  

My current stack includes JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, CSS and HTML.  I look forward to adding to this list as I grow as a developer.
